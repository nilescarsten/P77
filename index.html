            Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud
             applications.

            It usually means a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which 
            allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system.

            When we write and edit code in the Codecademy exercises we are using a console which is a piece of software that 
            allows us to test and experiment with code.

            Use your mouse and right click on the screen.Choose the option "inspect".On the top, you can see options.Choose the 
            one that says console.And now, the console screen is open.
            You can use and code in console.log to print anything.
           </p>

            var last_name = "cristen";
            console.log(last_name);

            var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);

            var a = 12;
            var b = 6;
            var add = a + b ;
